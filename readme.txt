Well, since it's not directly convert it rather than converting each integer to byte that eventually convert it to md5 then equalize it to the input.

Requirement: Python (currently tested on python 3)

How to use:
1.) Change value on variable md5text inside scan.py
2.) Open cmd and navigate to scanner folder and type
   python scan.py


Configuring:
You can set how much thread that it will use to scan it by changing value on variable numberOfCore inside scan.py. Note: to avoid freezing your comp, please use less than total of threads in your comp.
